Hi, my name is Sammy Lee - Data Scientist.  

Studying economics in the middle of the 2009 financial crisis taught me the value of combining common sense with data to recognize financial anomolies like asset bubbles.  

### My Business Philosophy
- I'm a firm believer in the Amazon flywheel model, but instead of lower prices it's better customer service that creates a growing snowball effect.  If you have a subscription business model - great.  If you don't, then the closest substitute would be cusomer loyalty.  I find that many businesses I've personally dealt with work from a script when dealing with their customers.  A more effective approach to customer service would be to listen carefully and collect data about their problems.  
### Economics
Growing up I was and still am fascinated by how money works as a incentive to organize society and bring people together in a peaceful way.
