Hi, my name is Sammy Lee - Data Scientist.  

Studying economics in the middle of the 2009 financial crisis taught me the value of combining common sense with data to recognize financial anomolies like asset bubbles.  

### Economics
Growing up I was and still am fascinated by how money works as a incentive to organize society and bring people together in a peaceful way.
